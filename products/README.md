<u>Notes from Dr. Handel</u>

If any figure or other file is created by running code, it should go into a subfolder inside `/results`. If something is generated manually, e.g. a diagram using biorender, place it in the appropriate `assets` folder inside `products`. As needed, make new (sub)-folders.

Often you need a library of references in bibtex format, as well as a CSL style file that determines reference formatting. Those files might be used by several of the products, They should be placed into the `assets` folder.

You can add further folders. If you make a scientific poster, that should go into a `poster` folder. Or you could have a `website` folder if you plan to write a blog-post or make an interactive shiny-app for your project.
